Real-time Ingestion in Big Data
- Data is ingested in real-time or near real-time as it is generated
- Suitable for time-sensitive data
- Tools: Apache Kafka, Apache Flume, Amazon Kinesis


Messaging Queues Systems:
- enables applications to communicate and exchange data asynchronously by sending message through a queue.
- Producers send messages without waiting for consumers to process them immediately.
- This decouples systems, improves scalability, and enhances fault tolerance and also ensures reliable data delivery.
- Examples: Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, Amazon SQS

Suppose an online shopping website sends order events to a queue, while inventory, payment and notification services consume these events independently.
- This allows the website to handle high traffic without delays, while other services process orders at their own pace.

Architecture of Messaging Queue System:
Message queue architecture consists of producer, queue/topics, brokers, and consumer components.
Producer publish the messages to the broker which stores them in the queue until consumers retrieve and process them.
Consumer read messages at their own pace, enabling fault tolerance and load balancing.

1. Producer: Application that sends messages to the queue.
2. Queue: Temporary storage that holds messages until they are processed.
3. Consumer: Application that retrieves and processes messages from the queue.


Broker vs Broker-less Messaging:
- Broker based systems uses a central server to store and route messages.
- Broker-less systems allow direct communication between producers and consumers without an intermediary.

Examples:
- Broker based: Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ
- Broker-less: ZeroMQ, Redis Pub/Sub


Distributed Broker:
- A distributed broker system consists of multiple broker nodes that work together to handle large volumes of messages.
- Data is partitioned across brokers for scalability and fault tolerance.
- Netflix uses distributed Kafka brokers to process millions of streaming events per second.


Apache Kafka:
- Distributed, fault tolerant, high-throughput messaging system designed for real-time data streaming.
- It stores data in topics and allows multiple producers and consumers to read and write data concurrently.


Kafka Broker:
- Kafka broker is a server that stores topic partitions and servers data to consumers.
- Multiple brokers form a Kafka cluster for scalability and fault tolerance.

Kafka Producer:
- Publishes messages to Kafka topics.
- Producer decide which partition a message goes to based on a key or round-robin.

Kakfka Consumer:
- Reads messages from Kafka topics.
- Consumers can work independently or in a consumer group for load balancing.


Zookeeper - manages metadata and coordinates Kafka brokers in a cluster.
Kafka broker - stores messages
Kafka producer - sends messages to topics
Kafka consumer - retrieves messages from topics
